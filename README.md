SNAKE: THE VOID EDITION
A single-file, no-internet, terminal-green existential crisis.
SNAKE: The Void Edition is not just a game; it's a planned system failure. This project takes the classic Snake game and subjects it to escalating levels of digital corruption and metaphysical chaos, culminating in an inverted, high-speed, boundary-breaking nightmare called T H E   V O I D.
⚠️ PHOTOCENTIVITY / EPILEPSY WARNING ⚠️
This game features rapid, intense color changes (particularly in the final VOID phase, which uses a full-screen color inversion filter), flashing elements, glitch effects, and screen shaking.
If you are susceptible to photosensitive epilepsy or other visual disturbances, proceed with extreme caution or DO NOT play.
Visual Vibe (The Chaos Aesthetics)
To capture the true offline terminal experience, the game uses minimalist, code-generated graphics.
 * SNAKE: Bright Green (#0f0), smooth movement.
 * MORONS: Deep Blue (#55f). Clumsy bots that crash into walls and dissolve in blue particle bursts.
 * IDIOT BOT: Cyan (#0ff). Unpredictable, hostile movement, passes through boundaries, and twitches frequently.
 * AMOGUS: Red with Cyan Visor. A small, fast, aggressive entity. Contact triggers a screen shake and the system crash/meta-screen.
 * T H E V O I D: FULL COLOR INVERSION. Everything white becomes black, green becomes magenta/red, and the background glows. High-speed, chaotic movement with intense visual discomfort.

Features
This game is entirely contained within a single index.html file, designed to run perfectly offline—a true "bunker gaming" experience.
The Phases of Chaos (Acts):
 * ACT I: The Setup (NORMAL): Standard Snake rules. Enjoy it while it lasts.
 * ACT II: Trash Time: The initial enemy (the "smart bot") attempts to flee to the lower-right corner (the "trash") to terminate itself, initiating the real chaos.
 * ACT III: 3 MORONS: Three slow, clumsy, blue-colored bots spawn. They wander aimlessly and die when they hit the screen boundaries. They serve as harmless but distracting digital noise.
 * ACT IV: IDIOT BOT: A single, cyan-colored, immortal bot that moves randomly and aggressively, passing through walls. It is hostile and WILL kill you on contact. This bot is programmed to embody utter, unpredictable chaos.
 * ACT V: FOOD HEAVEN: The screen floods with yellow food tiles, offering a brief moment of frantic joy before the final confrontation.
 * ACT VI: AMOGUS: A red entity spawns, constantly pursuing the player. Contact with this entity doesn't kill you—it triggers a system crash and the "Happy End" meta-screen, breaking the game's fourth wall.
 * ACT VII: T H E   V O I D: The post-game mode. The screen inverts colors, speed increases dramatically, and exiting the screen boundaries causes the snake to dissolve (lose segments). This is the true, high-speed, final existential challenge.
Controls
 * Keyboard: Arrow Keys (↑↓←→)
 * Mobile: Dedicated on-screen directional buttons.
